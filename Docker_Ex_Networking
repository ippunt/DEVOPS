By default every container can talk to each other! Must build networking for isolation. 
1. Port forwarding to conatiner machine and which bridge to put it on
-p <host port>:<Container port>
2. IP with port forwarding. IP has to be on host. 
3. Creating Bridger and utilization.

1. sudo docker run it -p 80:800 -p 102:10201 -p 502:5020

2. -p 192.168.1.100:8080:80;    You will only use this if your host is being forwaded traffic for another host or has multiple IPs
vim /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml;  under addresses: - 192.168.1.10/24; - 192.168.1.20/24; sudo netplan apply;
This IP needs to be a host IP. 

3.
docker network create net1
docker run --net net1 --name tulipnginx -d nginx;
